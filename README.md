# Company Employee Database

## Welcome!

Thank you for checking out the company database! In here, you will be able to view a list of all of the current employees, job titles, departments, etc.

### How to use:

    To get started, log in through Postgres in your terminal. You can then initialize the "schema.sql" file inside of the db folder. This will create the database and seed it with all of the information you need! It will also connect you to the database so that you can interact with it!

    Once you've started up the server, head back into your terminal and run the "node index.js" command. From here, you will be prompted to make a selection. You can view departments, add roles, all kinds of good stuff!

    Once you've viewed/edited the database to your liking, you can exit by selecting the "Exit" option in the terminal.

    Thanks for checking out the company employee database!
